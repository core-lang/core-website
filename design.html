      Some believe that adding features improves a language.<br>
      This is not a language for those.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      In a world in which languages add features<br>
      until they collapse under their own weight,<br>
      build a language that is content with itself.
    </div>
    <h4>compatibility</h4>
    <div class="section">
      Spend the engineering effort to make the language amenable for change,<br>
      instead of making ossification a forgone conclusion.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      The least painful time for a breaking change is now.

    <h4>performance</h4>
    <div class="section">
      The language is designed to allow an implementation that is fast and efficient.<br>
      There are no language features that introduce a slow-path.
